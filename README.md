# Topology
Everything I learned studying Topology with Professor Starbird

Above is a PDF of a notebook that required for my flipped classroom. In my flip classroom I was given defintion. With these definitions we were to go through and prove the following theorems. Until any given Theorem was proved we were not able to use it towards another theorem. So as you can see the material builds off of itself. If anyone is interested, please go through and try it yourself. Be weary there might be some mistakes in my proofs, and if you do catch any please contact me at thomas.lockwood@utexas.edu.
